## Structure

The code is organized into the following components:

   - Inherits from `tk.Tk` to create the main application window.
   - Initializes the GUI elements such as the table, entry fields, buttons, and menus.

2. **GUI Elements**:
   - **Table (Treeview)**: Displays customer records in a tabular format.
   - **Entry Fields**: For entering customer details (name, family name, national ID, etc.).
   - **Buttons**: Perform actions like adding, editing, deleting, and clearing records.
   - **Menus**: Provide additional functionality like searching and refreshing the table.

3. **Database Operations**:
   - Uses SQLite3 to store and retrieve customer data.
   - Functions like `add()`, `update()`, `remove()`, and `query_database()` handle database interactions.

4. **Helper Functions**:
   - Functions like `lookup()` for searching, `clear_entries()` for clearing input fields, and `up()`/`down()` for moving records within the table.

5. **Main Execution Block**:
   - Ensures the application runs only when executed directly.
